# Bash Manual

## Introduction 

### What is shell ?

Unix shell = both **command interpreter** and **programming language**. Can be used **interactively** (input) or non-interactively (from file) (for minishell -> interactive shell).

Shell allows **executing commands** : GNU commands and built-in commands (_builtins_).
